This is my project for CS625.

It is based on PaulPauls' work at https://github.com/PaulPauls/llama3_interpretability_sae

Unfortunately, I did not get around to commenting the code, and my changes are thoroughly scattered throughout the codebase. To see my contributions, I recommend that you view the changes in my commit here: https://github.com/RudyNahra/CS625proj/commit/d18fd080f2073f58ce2053054b6e20b1ba6df42b
